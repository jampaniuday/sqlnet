This is just a test case to prove that SQL92_Security has no 
effect on the table owner, only on those with privs to the 
table in question.

Test case:

SQL92_security = false;

Create table as user A
Grant delete on table to user B

As user A:
 delete from table where id = 1;
 rollback

As user b:
 delete from table where id = 1;
 rollback

Both tests should succeed.


SQL92_security = true;

Perform same tests as previous.
DELETE should fail for user B
